Before you do anything
=============
I Don't know where you found this repo, perhaps Alliedmods or SourceForge?

This is an old plugin that I made decade ago. I'm currently starting a new repo, and using my free time to rewrite some of the source code to bring it up to date a bit and run more efficiently.

There may be random errors. Please use it with caution.

Features
-----------
- Spawn props and build houses in source games. (currently dedicated to HL2DM)
- Realtime prop info on HUD
- Spawnable ragdolls, wheels, doors
- Stacking, extending, aligning!
- `Save system` that can save your personal progress with different savenames and load them tomorrow
- Blacklists to temporarily restrict some naughty friends
- NoKill to protect player from RDMers
- `sm_ent_fire` that replicates `ent_fire`, because Valve is dumdum that made people requires rcon access to use ent_fire no matter what.
- `+grabent` and `+copyent` that helps you building bases with ease
- `+sprint` and `sm_tp` to make you go around fast.
- LASERS, because why not? ;D
- and many other things!
